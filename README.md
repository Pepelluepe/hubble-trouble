## About

Hubble Trouble is a game that I've been thinking about making for years. This game is inspired by Frog Fractions, The Impossible Quiz, Cod of Duty, and other off-color, multi-genre, or parody titles. Other inspiration has come from a childhood of Gameboy and PC games.

I'd love this game to not only be fun, but an educational tool for other developers to be able to learn from a variety of game development techniques. This game covers a variety of genres and covers multiple examples of development approaches that might be helpful to aspiring or learning programmers. Please let me know if you've found this project helpful or interesting.
